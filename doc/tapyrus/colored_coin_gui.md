 Tapyrus GUI has been enhanced to allow Token transactions. Following are the changes made

 ### Overview Page
 Overview in the new Tapyrus GUI shows tokens as well. TPC is in view when the gui starts. _Prev_ and _Next_ buttons can be used to scroll through all the available tokens. When no other tokens are available only TPC is visible.
